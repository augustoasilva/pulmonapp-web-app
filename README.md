### About Pulmonar Team

Led by [Prof. Caio Damasceno](https://www.instagram.com/damascenocaio/) the Pulmonar Team is a multi-professional collaboration network of people interested in the technology area that has joined together to try to contribute to the treatment of people infected with COVID- 19.

The team's objective is to contribute to the treatment of patients infected with the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. And this will be accomplished through a multi-professional team within the technology area, adapting respirators commonly used in the treatment of the disease, to serve more than one patient, reaching up to 4 patients simultaneously.
